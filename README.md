# 3D-Egg
Simple program that draws 3D object with egg-like shape

This program uses parametric equations to draw points which can be connected to create a 3D egg, 
additionaly this program draws X, Y and Z axes. To make the program more interesting and to show
the drawn shape better, the egg is constantly rotating around all axes.

There are three drawing modes, they can be switched with keyboard keys:
p - draws an egg made only from points
w - draws points connected with lines
s - draws fully textured egg
